# Pace-Hancock-Petigrew-Company1847
A large group of Mormon Battalion veterans traveled along the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada mountains of Alta California, after their discharge from
the Army of the west after the end of the war with Mexico, 1847.  Their trail diaries record some amazing experiences, as well as names of many
native american tribes, bands, and individuals, most of whom are lost to recorded history due to disasterous events that followed during the gold rush. This
project is an attempt to collaborate with you using the technology that is now available, to stitch some of that history back together.

This KMZ file can be opened as a map in Google Earth.  It shows best-guess locations of camp sites and trail based (so far) on the diaries of James Pace,
Robert Stanton Bliss, and Levi Hancock.

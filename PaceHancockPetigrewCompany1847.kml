			<name>July 27, 1847 North East Hollow?</name>
			<description>27th. Marched through a hollow that went out N.E. and went winding through the tops of the mountains.  We followed the trail which must be many hundered years old.  It is worn down in some places three or four feet.  Crossed over high peaks and down into hollows. Sometimes the path is not more than one foot wide on the side of the mountain where if the horse had fell, it would have dashed him to death.  Sometimes on both sides it was so steep no creature of cattle kind could stand,  but we thought if Fremont had been there, we could.   Lost nine cattle.  They were wild and charged on any man who was in their way.  Some were shot and part saved and  brought in here.    Met Russel  Brownal and James Miller came up and told us that the other company was behind, coming and would be able to catch us in one or two days which caused us to rejoice much, and we have peace now.  No swearing or cursing each other.  All are trying to do as well as they can.  Brownal went back to inform the men where we are.  Many deer seen today, said to be small.  Last night a grizley bear came into our camp and we drove him off.  Our horses were much frightened and had have like to broke loose all around.  We were glad to have him leave.  Camped here.  Good timber and water to do for us and animals by waiting patiently.  The water that is found here is salt in these mountains.  The timber is mostly willows in these valleys, some oak, cottonwood,  sycamore.  Saw two beech trees.

			<name>July 28th, 1847 bad road (12 miles)</name>
			<description>28th.  We left our camp on the mountains in a beautiful valley and took up another canon comiing in from the northeast and crossed over another mountain continually ascending, going sometimes on the tops and sometimes on the sides of the mountains, winding our way, passing through valleys.  We, today have past through some good timber on the hills by the side of dry beds of the creek.  The roads are narrow, sometimes not over one foot wide, on the side hills.  There is considerable variety of timber in these mountains- some hemlock.  We have seen our route here no timber like the timber in the states.  The leaves are smaller.  Cedar is the most natural.

			<name>July 29, 1847 Hot springs (now cold) 12 miles</name>
			<description>After we past into the canon the 29th day, we found a stream of water running from the east and bearing to the northwest and winding through the mountains towards the sea.  We went up it for about one mile and it turned to the northeast, and went crooking around until we took another turn nearly northwest, and at once we came up to the foot of a mountain and it looked as if we could go no farther, but all at once we saw a light east and we saw that the stream came down between the mountains from the east.  We turned and went about one mile and it took another turn and came from the northeast.  On vally came in from the east.  We journeyed northeast and ascended the stream until we came what used to be called the hot springs three years ago, but now are cold.  We have traveled over the worst kind of a road between the mountains, and over rocks, and between them.  The would tear our boots.  The worst going I ever saw.  This day made twelve miles.  The counsel is to kill all the cattle tomorrow and dry it.

August 1, 1847.  This morning we packed up our beef and started on our journey.  Made fifteen miles.  Crossed over some small hills.  From last night&apos;s camp, we moved north for about two miles and turned over a hill a diagonal course into a valley, or a branch of the same that we started in.  Here is the hill that we past over and road up this branch.  Runs nearly northwest, after we had gone down on over the N.W. from the mouth of the canon we came out today.
- Levi Hancock
-------------------------
August the 1st. We again started on our course, passed through small valleys and over small ranges of mountains, and after a few days travel, we came to the extensive valley lying between the Sierra Nevada and the coast range of the mountains called the Tuele, or Tularry Valley. We continued our course between these two ranges of mountains, nearly Northwest, until the 20th, on which day we came to settlements on the River Sacrimento.º

			<name>August 3, 1847 Indian Tribe 12 miles upriver</name>
			<description>Along the Kern river at the edge of the valley floor, The returning Mormon Battalion veterans enjoyed a heartwarming visit with a local tribe-- Robert Bliss thought they were the &quot;Tule&quot; indians, possibly referring to the Tule-Kaweah band of Yokuts,  Penutian Family  (See 20e at http://www.californiaprehistory.com/tribmap.htm).  However, they also thought they were at the Tulare river, but evidence shows they were at the Kern river.  They may not have known the accurate name of the tribe.

-James Pace
-----------------------
We traveled about N. N.East eight miles and crossed the river.  The horses had to swim until another ford was found a little below that.  We camped on the river.  Some timber here for fire.  Many flags, poplar trees and cottonwoods.  It is a beautiful country-- water enough to water the whole country.  This wilear tribe of Indians have three thousand warriors and many old men they consider too old to fight.  They often fall on the spaniards and fight them.  It is said tha this is the tribe that Lieutenant Thompson fought by order of Col. Cooke, Lieutenant Col of the Mormon Battalion.
-Levi Hancock
------------------------
 The next morning, August 4th, he returned to camp with several Indians, one of them promised to go with us as guide for a few days.  The Indians told us that we would have to travel up the river about twenty miles before we could cross.  We gave them a few presents and continues our journey for about twenty miles, then we crossed it.  Some made a raft to carry over their things, others waded, carried things on their heads.  Our animals swam the river, it is about fifty yards wide and abounds with fish.
   The second day after starting, the Indian who agreed to travel with us a few days as guide, refused to go any father because we would not hire his entire company, eight in number.  We were now without a guide.
   Leaving the great valley on our left, we traveled over hills and lofty mountains and camped where water was so scarce that we were watering our animals all night.

-James Pace
-------------------------
We started early from our camp on the Rio Ra or Kings River, and had considerable brush and timber, and came out on a plain.  Past over a high hill at the head and then went down another, crooking around, between the lofty hills and narrow paths on the bottom of a dry stream.  No timber for a long way of any kind until we came down very low and saw timber still low down and soon we came to it and found down the stream, running to our right and to the east, a hole of water.  Here we had thought to stay and refresh ourselves and animals, but the pioneers went ahead, and to water all of our beasts would have taken till night.  We continued our journey and traveled as we had twelve miles back, a northeast course.  The same we continued until we made twenty eight, and camped in a hollow near or in sight of a high mountain east of us about four miles.  We have past a good deal of timber and through among the large oaks.  For mountain oak in the valleys and grows the cotonwood and poplar.  Saw one buckeye tree.  Northeast course all day.  Our road was crooked and this afternoon was coming over some big hills.  Poor feed and water tonight.

Frid 13th Augst Commenced our March through the Canion or pass up the mountains nearly an East course for about 10 miles &amp; encamped on a branch of the Main River; thus far we have found the Mts less Steep &amp; Rocky than we expected &amp; we hope we shall have no difficulty in the Assent or Decent of this Range of Mountains; Saw many Deer &amp; Antelope to day; We have been troubled by wasps &amp; Scorpions of late last night I was stung by a scorpion &amp; I was not alone for at least a half doz of our men was Stung also; they creep into our blankets nights which makes them verry unpleasant Bed­fellows there is a number of kinds of Snakes in this country but they are Generally harmless; I have seen on the Rout a kind of Rattle Snake 5 or 6 foot in length a dark mud colour as well as the large yellow Rattle Snake; Hares Rabbits &amp; a kind of Ground Squirrel &amp; plenty here; the Rackoon Badger &amp;c are in abundance; different kinds of wolves are so plenty that I have seen but few days in California without Seeing more or less of them; they used to Steal our meat while in quarters at San Diego &amp; their howls are as common to us as the barking of dogs used to be our boys have just returned from the mountains &amp; report unfavorable; they have been 15 miles ahead where the atmosphere was cool &amp; they could see snow on Mts ahead &amp; so verry Rocky that our animals could not possibly pass the In­dians also threatened them; much therefore our only alternity is to go back &amp; take the Rout for Suters fort north of this 150 or 200 miles before we can possibly cross the Mts &amp; we expect we shall suffer much before we can get to the north pass; there is one satisfaction we have we shall have a good chance to explore the Great Tule Vally its .Rivers &amp; Lakes &amp;c
